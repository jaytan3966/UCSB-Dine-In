# UCSB Dining Reviews
## Overview
Essentially Yelp for UCSB Dining

## MVP Features

Potential idea for format: When displaying the menu items for the day, be able to click on each item to access the reviews for those items. Maybe also have an option to got a page with all the possible menu items listed so u can see reviews for all items, even the unavailable ones.

### Reviews

Allow users to leave reviews of certain food items from the dining halls. These reviews should be added to the database

Format:
* Username (optional, add option to make anonymous review)
* Name of Food
* Rating
* Description
* Image (optional)

Need to think about how to display the reviews on the website

### Daily Menu

Use webscraping to find and display daily menu items

## Potential v2 Features

Sort of like Reddit. Should determine which reviews get pushed to the top

### Reply to Reviews

Let other people reply to reviews

### User log in

Keep track of posted reviews. Gain title / status / profile decoration when a user posts a lot of reviews (like Yelp)
